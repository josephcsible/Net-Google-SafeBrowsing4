Net-Google-SafeBrowsing4
========================

Net::Google::SafeBrowsing4 implements the Google Safe Browsing v4 Local API

The library passes most of the unit tests listed in the API documentation. 

The Google Safe Browsing database must be stored and managed locally.
Net::Google::SafeBrowsing4::File uses files as the storage back-en.
Other storage mechanisms (databases, memory, etc.) can be added and used transparently with this module.


The source code is available on github at https://github.com/juliensobrier/Net-Google-SafeBrowsing4.
